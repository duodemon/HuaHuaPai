## Gameplay

###### Starting a game

At the start of the entire match, one person is designated to be the banker. The game starts with the banker. The next player becomes the banker after each game. Let's call the banker as player 1, the next player as player 2, and the last player as player 3. The game always runs clockwise.

At the start of each game, the deck is shuffled by the banker. After the deck has been shuffled, the last player cuts the deck. Starting from the banker, each player sequentially draws one card.

###### Winning a game

There is a pot with a maximum quantity of 16 cards. To win the game, a player must put at least six cards into the pot. Cards are placed into the pot as a result of not being eaten by other cards.

###### Free play and eating

After the cards have been drawn, the banker is free to play whatever he/she wants. Once cards have been played, the next player attempts to eat it. Cards are eaten when cards of higher value and the same card combinations are played. There are some special cases for this (See Card combinations), notably Bulls eat all cards of the same size except for gods, Opera groups cannot be eaten, and Fish can only be eaten by Pendulums and Pendulums can only eat Fish. Anytime a player is able to eat the cards that other players have played, **that player MUST EAT IT**, although playing the largest cards is not necessary.

If the next player passes, it goes to the third player and if that player passes, those cards are added to the pot and the banker gets to play again.

###### One round

A round will always consist of each player getting one turn. So if the player 2 eats, the player 3 can eat but player 1 is not allowed to eat due to the round ending at player 3, regardless if player 1 has big enough cards to eat.

So let's say player 2 eats but player 3 passes. Player 2 is now free to play whatever cards and the same eating rounds occur.

###### Covering and lifting the lid

Where the game gets interesting is when a player ends their turn. Let's say player 1 plays 3 Gods and 3 Bulls (unbeatable) and ends turn (covered the lid) to reach 6 cards in the pot and winning the game. Player 2 may not have good cards originally, but upon knowing that 3 Gods and 3 Bulls are out of play, his/her smaller cards are now big. But since player 1 has covered the lid, player 2 cannot just freely play cards unlike player 1 (which is why being the banker is such a huge advantage). To play cards, player 2 can call for a lift to lift the lid off the pot that has been covered. The player who covered must play something and the player who lifted must eat the cards and win the round for the player to freely play.

Player 2 wants to win this game too, so he/she calls for a lift. Player 1 thinks for a bit to estimate what are the most likely cards that player 2 does not have. Since Sixes are absolutely useless cards to have and provide 0 information, player 1 plays four Sixes. Darn, player 2 doesn't eat quadruples, so he passes. Player 3 just happens to have 4 Sevens, so he eats it and now is free to play. He just needs two more cards to win, so he plays an Opera pair and covers the lid. Since there are already 12 cards in the pot, and the maximum number of cards is 16, player 2 is squeezed out of the game and player 1 wins the game with a strong hand while player 3 also wins the game with a garbage hand. Thanks for the lift, player 2!

If a player lifts but does not win, that player must pay the player he lifted from 2 points for each lift. (See Scoring)

Note: If a player is free to play and has unbeatable cards to reach 6 cards, **the player MUST play those cards**. Otherwise you are scamming the other players into lifting.

###### Limiting cards

A player who is playing cards can call for a "card limit" and every player must discard until their number of hand cards match the number of free card spaces in the pot. This provides more strategy as the players who are limiting face dilemmas.

Example: There are 13 cards played in the pot and player 2 has played 3 of those cards. It is now player 2's turn to freely play. 3 Gods and all Operas and Bulls have been played. Player 3 has 3 Tigers and a Pendulum. It seems at first that there is no way player 2 is getting past player 3 as player 3 eats Singles, Pairs, Triples, and Fish. However, upon player 2 calling for a card limit, player 3 can only keep 3 cards. So he keeps the 3 Tigers. Player 2 plays a Fish and wins. Mind games.

###### Ending a game

A game ends when all players have covered the lid or if there isn't enough space in the pot to make a difference in the scoring. At the end of each game, scoring is calculated. The losing player(s) must "pay" the winning player(s) points depending on what cards were played. In real life playing just for fun, this may be represented with poker cards or poker chips. If playing for money, each point represents some money.

The next player then becomes the banker. So that would be player 2 in our example.

###### Scoring

Here is how scoring is calculated:

| Card combination | Points awarded | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enough | 1 | Having 6 cards in the pot.|
| Opera pair| 1 | Must be the first cards played when possible for it to award the points. |
| Opera triplet| 2 | Must be the first cards played when possible for it to award the points. |
| Opera quadruplet| 4 | 1 more point than a triplet as a reward for having all four cards. Must be the first cards played when possible for it to award the points.|
| Bull pair| 1 | |
| Bull triplet| 2 | |
| Bull quadruplet| 4 | 1 more point than a triplet as a reward for having all four cards.|
| Four of a kind | 1 | All four cards must be played at once as a quadruplet for this to count. Exception to this are Red eyes and Gods - four of these cards can be played in any variation and it will always count as 1 extra point. This is because Gods represent the sky and Red eyes represent the earth and earth and sky cannot ever be separated.|
| Failed lift | 2 | If a player lifts but did not have enough, he must pay the player he lifted from 2 points.|
| 11 card assassination | 3 | 11 cards in pot. |
| 12 card assassination | 4 | 12 cards in pot. |
| 13 card assassination | 5 | 13 cards in pot. |
| 14 card assassination | 6 | 14 cards in pot. |
| 15 card assassination | 7 | 15 cards in pot. |
| 16 card assassination | 8 | 16 cards in pot. |
| 7 reds assassination | 8 | At the start of a game, if a player has 7 red cards in his hand, he can reveal to instantly win.|
| 14 blacks assassination | 8 | At the start of a game, if a player has 14 black cards in his hand, he can reveal to instantly win.|
| 8 pairs assassination | 8 | At the start of a game, if a player has 8 pairs in his hand, he can reveal to instantly win.|

###### Ending the match

The match is ended when a player has negative points. Each player's points at the beginning of the match is modifiable. Depending on how your group of friends play, you can also be allowed to "borrow" points from other players and repay them once you've won more than your debt. VERY bad idea when playing for money though. (Gambling is bad)

## Strategies and Notes

Opera groups win a lot of points, but they only count if you play them first. Remember to play them first!

There are ways to bypass the rule where if you have unbeatable cards, you must play them. If you have Quadruples (quite rare), Double fishes (quite rare), Triple fishes (very rare), Miscellaneous fishes (quite rare), you can cover the lid. If the next player lifts, you can play those cards to win and possibly squeeze them out of spots in the pot to win their lift points. It bypasses the scamming rule because while it's pretty much a guaranteed win, it can be eaten so you are allowed to cover the lid. The risk is that if everybody else has bad cards, they don't lift and you lose out on the guaranteed win.

If you are the banker and have really high cards but just not enough to win, you can play something to poke down the remaining high cards and lift again to win. For example, you have 3 Gods with Pendulum and 3 Tigers and a Fish. That's only 5 unbeatable cards so you play a single Tiger to poke down the God and lift again with excellent chances of winning. Only way you cannot win is if the other player has some crazy combination, like a Miscellaneous fish to squeeze you out.

Remember to limit cards! There have been times where I've won off a pair of Widowed big bulls due to card limiting (lol).

Always be aware of what's already played! You can see if your Tiger or Ten has become big and if your hand is liftable.

Sixes and Sevens are by far the absolute worst cards in the game. For some reason every players complains about "always" drawing them.

When freely playing, if you can't get Enough, don't play your big cards just for the sake of playing. It reveals valuable information and you might want your big cards to lift again or to prevent someone from winning. Therefore when playing cards for a lift, play those useless Sixes and Sevens.

When playing cards for a lift, try to make an educated guess on what the lifter doesn't have. Usually try to play Triples (and Quadruples obviously if you have them). Usually you don't play Fish because Pendulums are too common. If it's the third player lifting, you can play a single card to pass the torch to the second player. Oh yeah, play your Opera groups first.
